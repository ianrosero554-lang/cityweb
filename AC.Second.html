        <h3>Faith, Integrity, and Responsible Digital Citizenship</h3>
        <p>I realise that faith, integrity, and responsible digital citizenship are deeply connected to how I live and make decisions every day. My faith guides my values and reminds me to act with honesty, respect, and compassion, even when no one is watching. Integrity pushes me to stay true to these principles in my academic work, relationships, and online behavior. Being a responsible digital citizen means using technology wisely—thinking before I post, avoiding harmful actions like plagiarism or cyberbullying, and contributing positively to online communities. Altogether, these values shape me into someone who is not only knowledgeable but also trustworthy, respectful, and mindful in both the physical and digital world.</p>
