     <p>Our school emphasizes the importance of <b>moral and ethical behavior</b> in the digital world, helping students understand how their actions online affect others. This includes building awareness of **digital citizenship**, where learners practice responsibility, respect, and safety in every online interaction. By teaching these values, the school ensures that students develop healthy habits that guide their behavior across all digital platforms.</p>    </div>

    <div class="fade-in-box">
        <p>A key concept we focus on is <b>online kindness</b>, which encourages students to communicate respectfully and consider the feelings of others in virtual spaces. This includes avoiding harmful behaviors like cyberbullying and practicing empathy when participating in online discussions or collaborative work. Through everyday examples and guided activities, students learn how small positive actions can create a supportive digital environment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fade-in-box">
        <p>Another essential value is <b>honesty in digital creation</b>, which teaches students to produce original work and give proper credit when using others' ideas. This includes understanding plagiarism, practicing accurate attribution, and creating with integrity. By fostering these ethical principles, our school helps students become thoughtful, responsible digital creators who contribute positively to the online world.</p>
