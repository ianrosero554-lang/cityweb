My goals is to achieve my spitualities of being studying, brightning the heart to gain my love, and realise myself from me. I continue my journey as a college student, I see my goals, my work, and my guiding values shining together under the theme “Light of the World.” My goals push me to grow not only in academic excellence but also in character, reminding me that true success comes from using my abilities to bring positivity and hope to others. The work I do—whether studying, collaborating, or creating—becomes meaningful when I approach it with purpose, dedication, and a desire to serve. My guiding values, such as compassion, humility, integrity, and faith, help me stay grounded and remind me to act as a light in every environment I enter, especially in a world that can often feel uncertain. By striving to live with honesty, kindness, and responsibility, I aim to reflect the light of Christ in my actions and decisions. In this way, my personal growth becomes a way to inspire, uplift, and make a difference, allowing me to carry the message of being a “Light of the World” into both my present journey and the future I hope to build.</p></center>
